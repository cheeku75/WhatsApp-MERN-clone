• Leveraged Postman to perform comprehensive testing of the REST API of the clone by sending HTTP requests to verify
endpoints

• Utilized advanced features of Node.js, Express.js such as event-driven programming and asynchronous processing to
optimize the performance of the clone

• Used MongoDB, a NoSQL database, to store and retrieve chat messages and user data efficiently and scalably

• Integrated MongoDB with Pusher, to enable real-time communication between users and ensure that messages and other
data are updated in real-time

• Designed and implemented a responsive user interface with React.js components, props, and state to create a modular and
